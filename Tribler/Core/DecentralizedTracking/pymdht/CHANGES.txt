=== 11.8.2

- Bugfix: there was no error msg handler in exp_plugin_template.py

=== 11.8.0

- Refined all code related to bootstraping.
- Added GUI code (from Shariq)

=== 11.07

- Profiling toolkit integrated (profiler directory)

- Many nodes to bootstrap into the overlay. boostrap.main contains nodes
controlled by us and bootstrap.backup contains nodes we have seen alive for a
long time.

- The default path is now ~/.pymdht. Deleting that directory cleans any state
(it would be as if the code never run before on the machine).  

- TODO: some plugins do not work, need to clean up or fix them

- TODO: if connectivity is lost for a long enough period (1 hour?), all nodes
will be expelled from the routing table. Need to stop expelling nodes when n
timeouts in a row.

=== v1.0, 31 Jan 2011 -- Initial release with proper documentation
